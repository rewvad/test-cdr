CDR-Stats is an open source CDR_ (Call Detail Record) mediation rating, analysis
and reporting application for Freeswitch, Asterisk, Kamailio and other types of
proprietary VoIP Switch including Sipwise and Veraz. Other types of switch could
be added in the future such as Cisco and Alcatel-Lucent.

It allows you to mediate, rate and interrogate your CDR_ to provide reports and
statistics via a simple to use, yet powerful, web interface.

It is based on the Django_ Python Framework, Celery_, Gevent_, PostgreSQL_ and InfluxDB_.
