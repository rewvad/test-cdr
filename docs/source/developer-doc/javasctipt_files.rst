Javascript Files
================


* `jQuery`_ is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript.

* `NVD3`_ is an attempt to build re-usable charts and chart components for d3.js without taking away the power that d3.js gives you. This is a very young collection of components, with the goal of keeping these components very customizeable, staying away from your standard cookie cutter solutions.

* `Bootstrap`_ is sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.

* `Bootbox`_ is a small JavaScript library which allows you to create programmatic dialog boxes using Twitterâ€™s Bootstrap modals, without having to worry about creating, managing or removing any of the required DOM elements or JS event handlers.

* `Bootstrap-datepicker`_ Datepicker for Bootstrap
