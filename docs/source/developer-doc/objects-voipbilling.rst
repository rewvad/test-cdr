VoIPRetailPlan
--------------

This contains the `VoIPRetailRates`, the list of rates to retail to the customer.
These plans are associated to the VoIPPlan with a ManyToMany relation.

It defines the costs at which we sell the VoIP calls to the clients.
VoIPRetailPlan will then contain a set of VoIPRetailRates which will define the
cost of sending a VoIP to each destination.

The system can have several VoIPRetailPlans, but only the ones associated to the
VoIPplan will be used by the client.

Once the retail price is defined by the VoIPRetailPlan, we also need to know
which is the best route to send the call, what will be our cost, and which
Gateway/Provider will be used. 

VoIPCarrierPlan is linked to the VoIPRetailPlan, so once we have determined the destination, we need to look at which carrier (Provider) we want to use.
The VoIPCarrierPlan defines exactly this.

The system can have several VoIPCarrierPlans, but only the one associated to the
VoIPRetailPlan-VoIPPlan will be used to connect the VoIP of the client.
