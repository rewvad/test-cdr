General Configuration
=====================

Some of the more important parts of the configuration module for the cdr_stats,
``settings_local.py``, are explained below.

``APPLICATION_DIR`` now contains the full path of the project folder and can be
used elsewhere in the ``settings.py`` module so that the project may be moved
around the system without having to worry about changing any hard-coded paths::

    import os.path
    APPLICATION_DIR = os.path.dirname(globals()['__file__'])

Turns on debug mode allowing the browser user to see project settings and
temporary variables. ::

    DEBUG = True

Sends all errors from the production server to the admin's email address::

    ADMINS = ( ('xyz', 'xyz@abc.com') )


Sets up the options required for Django to connect to your database engine::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            # Add 'postgresql_psycopg2','postgresql','mysql','sqlite3','oracle'
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
            'NAME': 'DATABASENAME',
            'USER': 'DB_USERNAME',
            'PASSWORD': 'DB_PASSWORD',
            'HOST': 'DB_HOSTNAME',
            'PORT': 'DB_PORT',
            'OPTIONS': {
                #Postgresql Autocommit
                'autocommit': True,
            }
        },
        'import_cdr': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
            'NAME': 'cdr-pusher',
            'USER': 'postgres',
            'PASSWORD': 'password',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5433',
            'OPTIONS': {
                'autocommit': True,
            }
        }
    }


There are 2 database connections, 'default' is the main database of CDR-Stats
this contains all the tables. The second database 'import_cdr' is used to
import the CDRs from your switch. This database could be on another database
server but putting it on the CDR-Stats server is ideal.

CDR-Stats doesn't pull CDRs from your switch, it's the job of the switch to
push the CDRs to CDR-Stats.

A mechanism is required to get your CDRs to the 'import_cdr' database, to
assist with this, we created CDR-pusher project.
CDR-Pusher will usually be installed on your switch server, CDR-Pusher is a Go
application that can be extended, it could import CDRs from a different CDRs
Database (SQlite, PostgreSQL) and/or from CDR logs files.

Tells Django where to find your media files such as images that the ``HTML
templates`` might use. ::

    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(APPLICATION_DIR, 'static')

    ROOT_URLCONF = 'urls'


Tells Django to start finding URL matches at in the ``urls.py`` module in the
``cdr_stats`` project folder. ::

      TEMPLATE_DIRS = ( os.path.join(APPLICATION_DIR, 'templates'), )


Tells Django where to find the HTML template files::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.sites',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        ...
        'cdr',
        'cdr_alert',
        ...
    )

Tells Django which applications (custom and external) to use in the project.
The custom applications, ``cdr`` etc. are stored in the project folder along
with these custom applications.


Mail server
-----------

To configure the SMTP client so that reports and alerts are sent via email,
edit /usr/share/cdrstats/cdr_stats/settings_local.py, and identify the email section::

    #EMAIL BACKEND
    #=============
    # Email configuration
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'CDR-Stats <cdr-...@localhost.com>'
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'user...@gmail.com'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'
    EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX = '[CDR-Stats] '

Fill in the details to match your SMTP server. The above example is for Gmail.
When done, restart Celery and Apache.

To test that the email is working, from the command line type::

    $ cd /usr/src/cdr-stats/
    $ workon cdr-stats
    $ python manage.py send_daily_report
